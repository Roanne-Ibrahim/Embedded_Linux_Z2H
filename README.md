Phonebook using bash script on linux
-------------------------------------

1. The PhoneBook available options are:
  - Insert new contact name and number, with the option "-i"
  - View all saved contacts details, with the option "-v"
  - Search by contact name, with the option "-s"
  - Delete all records, with "-e"
  - Delete only one contact name, with "-d"
  
 2.Make the database inside the script itself (meaning the script would edit itself while running), that would make my script highly portable.
 
 3.A single name can have multiple phone numbers within the same database entry.
